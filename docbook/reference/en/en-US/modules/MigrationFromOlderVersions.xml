    <title>Migration from older versions</title>

    <para>
        To upgrade to a new version of Keycloak first download and install the new version of Keycloak. You then have to
        migrate the database, keycloak-server.json, providers, themes and applications from the old version.
    </para>

        <title>Migrate database</title>
        <para>
            Keycloak provides automatic migration of the database. It's highly recommended that you backup your
            database prior to upgrading Keycloak.
        </para>
        <para>
            To enable automatic upgrading of the database if you're using a relational database make sure
            <literal>databaseSchema</literal> is set to <literal>update</literal> for <literal>connectionsJpa</literal>:
<programlisting>
"connectionsJpa": {
    "default": {
        ...
        "databaseSchema": "update"
    }
}
</programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>
            For MongoDB do the same, but for <literal>connectionsMongo</literal>:
<programlisting>
"connectionsMongo": {
    "default": {
        ...
        "databaseSchema": "update"
    }
}
</programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>
            When you start the server with this setting your database will automatically be migrated if the database
            schema has changed in the new version.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Migrate keycloak-server.json</title>
        <para>
            You should copy <literal>standalone/configuration/keycloak-server.json</literal> from the old version to
            make sure any configuration changes you've done are added to the new installation. The version specific
            section below will list any changes done to this file that you have to do when upgrading from one version
            to another.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Migrate providers</title>
        <para>
            If you have implemented any SPI providers you need to copy them to the new server. The version
            specific section below will mention if any of the SPI's have changed. If they have you may have to update
            your code accordingly.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Migrate themes</title>
        <para>
            If you have created a custom theme you need to copy them to the new server. The version specific section below
            will mention if changes have been made to themes. If there is you may have to update your themes accordingly.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Migrate application</title>
        <para>
            If you deploy applications directly to the Keycloak server you should copy them to the new server. For any
            applications including those not deployed directly to the Keycloak server you should upgrade the adapter.
            The version specific section below will mention if any changes are required to applications.

                    In the past Direct Grant API (or Resource Owner Password Credentials) was disabled by default and
                    there was an option on a realm to enable it. The Direct Grant API is now always enabled and the
                    option to enable/disable for a realm is removed.

                    There are few minor changes in UserFederationProvider interface. You may need to sync your implementation when upgrade
                    to newer version and upgrade few methods, which has changed signature. Changes are really minor, but were needed to improve performance of federation.

                    of Keycloak is now based on WildFly 9.0.0.Final. This als affects the overlay which can only be deployed
                    to WildFly 9.0.0.Final or JBoss EAP 6.4.0.GA. WildFly 8.2.0.Final is no longer supported for the server.

                    Keycloak is now available in 3 downloads: standalone, overlay and demo bundle. The standalone is intended
                    for production and non-JEE developers. Overlay is aimed at adding Keycloak to an existing WildFly 8.2 or EAP 6.4
                    installation and is mainly for development. Finally we have a demo (or dev) bundle that is aimed at
                    developers getting started with Keycloak. This bundle contains a WildFly server, with Keycloak server and
                    adapter included. It also contains all documentation and examples.

                    to <literal>realm url</literal>. This is required by OpenID Connect specification. If you're using our adapters
                    there's no change required, other than if you've been using bearer-only without specifying <literal>auth-server-url</literal>
                    you have to add it now. If you're using another library (or RSATokenVerifier) you need to make the corresponding

                    To comply with OpenID Connect specification the authentication and token endpoints have been changed
                    to having a single authentication endpoint and a single token endpoint. As per-spec <literal>response_type</literal>
                    and <literal>grant_type</literal> parameters are used to select the required flow. The old endpoints (<literal>/realms/{realm}/protocols/openid-connect/login</literal>,
                    <literal>/realms/{realm}/protocols/openid-connect/grants/access</literal>, <literal>/realms/{realm}/protocols/openid-connect/refresh</literal>,
                    <literal>/realms/{realm}/protocols/openid-connect/access/codes)</literal> are now deprecated and will be removed

                <title>Theme changes</title>
                <para>
                    The layout of themes have changed. The directory hierarchy used to be <literal>type/name</literal>
                    this is now changed to <literal>name/type</literal>. For example a login theme named <literal>sunrise</literal>
                    used to be deployed to <literal>standalone/configuration/themes/login/sunrise</literal>, which is now
                    moved to <literal>standalone/configuration/themes/sunrise/login</literal>. This change was done to
                    make it easier to have group the different types for the same theme into one folder.
                </para>
                <para>
                    If you deployed themes as a JAR in the past you had to create a custom theme loader which required
                    Java code. This has been simplified to only requiring a plain text file (<literal>META-INF/keycloak-themes.json</literal>)
                    to describe the themes included in a JAR. See the <link linkend='themes'>themes</link> section in the docs for more information.

                <title>Claims changes</title>
                <para>
                    Previously there was <literal>Claims</literal> tab in admin console for application and OAuth clients. This
                    was used to configure which attributes should go into access token for particular application/client. This was removed
                    and replaced with <link linkend='mappers'>Protocol mappers</link>, which are more flexible.
                </para>
                <para>
                    You don't need to care about migration of database from previous version.
                    We did migration scripts for both RDBMS and Mongo, which should ensure that claims configured for particular application/client
                    will be converted into corresponding protocol mappers (Still it's safer to backup DB before migrating to newer version though).
                    Same applies for exported JSON representation from previous version.
                </para>

                <title>Social migration to identity brokering</title>
                <para>
                    We refactored social providers SPI and replaced it with <link linkend="identity-broker">identity brokering SPI</link>,
                    which is more flexible. The <literal>Social</literal> tab in admin console is renamed to <literal>Identity Provider</literal> tab.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Again you don't need to care about migration of database from previous version similarly like for Claims/protocol mappers.
                    Both configuration of social providers and "social links" to your users will be converted to corresponding Identity providers.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Only required action from you would be to change allowed <literal>Redirect URI</literal> in the admin console of
                    particular 3rd party social providers. You can first go to the Keycloak admin console and copy Redirect URI from the page where
                    you configure the identity provider. Then you can simply paste this as allowed Redirect URI to the admin console
                    of 3rd party provider (IE. Facebook admin console).

                    DB Schema has changed.  We have added export of the database to Beta 1, but not the ability to import
                    the database from older versions. This will be supported in future releases.

                    For all clients except bearer-only applications, you must specify at least one redirect uri.  Keycloak
                    will not allow you to log in unless you have specified a valid redirect uri for that application.

                    ServleOAuthClient.getBearerToken() method signature has changed.  It now returns an AccessTokenResponse
                    so that you can obtain a refresh token too.

                    Adapters now check the access token expiration with every request.  If the token is expired, they will
                    attempt to invoke a refresh on the auth server using a saved refresh token.

                    There is a new credential type "secret".  Unlike other credential types, it is stored in plain text in
                    the database and can be viewed in the admin console.

                    There is no longer required Application or OAuth Client credentials.  These client types are now
                    hard coded to use the "secret" credential type.
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    Because of the "secret" credential change to Application and OAuth Client, you'll have to update
                    your keycloak.json configuration files and regenarate a secret within the Application or OAuth Client
                    credentials tab in the administration console.
